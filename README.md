This sql challenge was designed to test my aptitude with the creation of a series of sql queries using generated but appropriately formatted data to simulate information that might be present in many companies including employee information, their posistions and their salaries. I was tasked with finding information shown in the file sql_challenge. Each of those queries should return the desired infroation from the questions. In addition I was tasked with moving some of that information into a pandas dataframe which was done in the bonus.ipynb file. These sql queries were pulled into pandas from pandas.read_sql_query through an engine that was created by sql alchemy.
